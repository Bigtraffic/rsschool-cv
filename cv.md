## **About me:**

My first work experience was at McDonald's where I worked for five years from 2015 to 2020. Climbing up the career ladder from an employee to a manager, i've upgraded my soft skills in **_team management, emotional intelligence, stress tolerance and customer service._**

Getting my bachelor's degree in international relations, I've decided to change my working sphere to Learning and Development and started working for manufacturing corporation called Yazaki in 2020. At Yazaki i was occupied with implementation of corporate learning and development strategy for Yazaki's two factories in Russia. In a year with the company, i've developed my skills in **_project management_**, specifically for learning and talent management field.

In mid 2021 i decided to deepen my knowledge in L&D and got a remote job in L&D department's Soft Skills team of KPMG Russia. Since June 2022 the company is no longer called KPMG but Kept instead. In my current role as an L&D Specialist I'm in charge of **_planning and administraion_** for various educational projects within my team. I'm also a part of HR digital tools team within the company where i serve as an **_administrator of a corporate HR portal based on Sharepoint._**

**My future goal** is to become a valuable Frontend developer, as i've always been fancy of the sphere. I strongly believe that you can only develop when you are passionate about the field you're working in, that is why i choose FrontEnd and The Rolling Scopes School particulary.
